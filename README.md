# AskMe
*ChatGPT generated code*
OpenAI Whisper + ChatGPT + TTS

Ask questions to ChatGPT using your microphone. This code is mostly generated by ChatGPT-4, and the response is provided as an audio file. To use this project, you need an OpenAI API key with an active subscription.



### 1. Replace `openai.api_key` in AskMe.ipynb  with your actual API key (is billed):

```
openai.api_key = <your api-key>
```

### 2. Run the AskMe.ipynb in  [![image](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ajinkyagorad/AskMe/blob/main/askMe.ipynb)




This will prompt you to ask a question using your microphone. The audio will be converted to text using OpenAI's Whisper API, sent to ChatGPT for processing, and the response will be converted to speech using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) library. The resulting audio file will be saved as a WAV file.

**Note**: Make sure to keep your OpenAI API key secure and do not include it directly in your code or commit it to your GitHub repository.
