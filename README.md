# AskMe

OpenAI Whisper + ChatGPT + TTS

Ask questions to ChatGPT using your microphone. This code is mostly generated by ChatGPT-4, and the response is provided as an audio file. To use this project, you need an OpenAI API key with an active subscription.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this repository to your local machine

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/askme.git
\`\`\`

### 2. Change to the `askme` directory

\`\`\`bash
cd askme
\`\`\`

### 3. Install the required dependencies

Install the dependencies using:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

### 4. Set up an environment variable for the OpenAI API key

Replace `your_api_key` with your actual API key:

\`\`\`bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
\`\`\`

### 5. Run the main script

\`\`\`bash
python askme.py
\`\`\`

This will prompt you to ask a question using your microphone. The audio will be converted to text using OpenAI's Whisper API, sent to ChatGPT for processing, and the response will be converted to speech using a Text-to-Speech (TTS) library. The resulting audio file will be saved as a WAV file.

**Note**: Make sure to keep your OpenAI API key secure and do not include it directly in your code or commit it to your GitHub repository.
